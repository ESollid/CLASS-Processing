# CLASS-Processing

This code has been used in undergraduate physics course development in an introductory course on electrostatics and magnetostatics.
It processes CLASS survey data that is fed to it in the form given in the "Post Survey - Example.csv"
It also saves key statistical information about the data and generates some example plots of how you could visualize the data.

It may not be perfect, but I hope that anyone who would be looking to work with these statistical tools would be able to benefit from the created python code.
You can use this survey in any science course to examine the impact any intervention may have on student attitudes about science.
